# patches/

pnpm patch overrides for third-party dependencies.

## Usage

When a dependency needs a local fix (bug workaround, security patch, etc.), use `pnpm patch <package>` to create a patch file here. Patches are applied automatically on `pnpm install`.

## Current State

No active patches. The `.gitkeep` file preserves the directory for future use.

**Crocbot** is a personal AI assistant you run on your own VPS. It answers you on **Telegram** via a full grammY bot integration, with an always-on **Gateway** control plane managing sessions, agents, tools, and automation.

Fork of [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), stripped down to **CLI + Telegram** for lean, single-user deployment.

## What is Crocbot?

Crocbot is a Telegram-first personal AI assistant that runs as a background service on your server. The Gateway is the always-on control plane — it manages your Telegram bot connection, agent sessions, cron jobs, webhooks, and tools. You interact with it via Telegram DMs/groups or the `crocbot` CLI.

---

## Quick Start

**Runtime:** Node >= 22

```bash
npm install -g crocbot@latest
# or: pnpm add -g crocbot@latest

crocbot onboard --install-daemon
```

The onboarding wizard walks through API keys, Telegram bot setup, workspace configuration, and skills. It installs the Gateway as a systemd user service so it stays running.

```bash
# Start the gateway manually (if not using the daemon)
crocbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose

# Send a message from the CLI
crocbot agent --message "Ship checklist" --thinking high
```

## Install from Source

Prefer **pnpm** for source builds. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moshehbenavraham/crocbot.git
cd crocbot

pnpm install
pnpm build

pnpm crocbot onboard --install-daemon

# Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)
pnpm gateway:watch
```

`pnpm crocbot ...` runs TypeScript directly via `tsx`. `pnpm build` produces `dist/` for the packaged `crocbot` binary.

---

## Docker

```bash
# Build the image (requires dist/ from pnpm build)
pnpm build
docker build -t crocbot:local .

# Start the gateway
docker compose up -d crocbot-gateway

# CLI access
docker compose run --rm crocbot-cli status
```

Environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.) are read from `.env` or exported. Volumes mount `~/.crocbot` (config) and `~/croc` (workspace).

See [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) and [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Full docs: [Docker install](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/install/docker)

## Architecture

```
              Telegram
             (grammY bot)
                  │
                  ▼
     ┌────────────────────────┐
     │        Gateway         │
     │   (WebSocket + HTTP)   │
     │  ws://127.0.0.1:18789  │
     └────────────┬───────────┘
                  │
     ┌────────────┼────────────┐
     │            │            │

    LLM Providers
  (Claude, GPT, Gemini, …)
```

The Gateway is the single control plane. Telegram messages flow in, get routed to agent sessions, and responses stream back. The CLI connects to the same Gateway over WebSocket.

## Models

Crocbot supports multiple LLM providers with auth profile rotation and failover:

| Provider | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, o3, Codex |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Claude via Bedrock |
| **Ollama** | Local models |
| **OpenRouter** | Multi-provider gateway |
| + more | GitHub Copilot, Moonshot, Qwen, Venice, … |

**Recommended:** Anthropic Pro/Max subscription + Opus for long-context strength and prompt-injection resistance.

---

## Configuration

Minimal `~/.crocbot/crocbot.json`:

```json5
{
  agent: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
  }
}
```

Key environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CROCBOT_STATE_DIR` | Runtime state directory (config, credentials, logs, memory) |
| `CROCBOT_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to main config file |
| `CROCBOT_WORKSPACE` | Agent working directory (prompts, skills, hooks) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |

Full reference: [Configuration](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/gateway/configuration)

---

## Telegram Setup

Set your bot token via environment or config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "123456:ABCDEF"
    }
  }
}
```

Or set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in your environment (env takes precedence).

### DM security

Default: **pairing mode** — unknown senders receive a pairing code. Approve with:

```bash
crocbot pairing approve telegram <code>
```

### Chat commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Session status (model, tokens, cost) |
| `/new` / `/reset` | Reset the session |
| `/compact` | Compact session context (summary) |
| `/think <level>` | Set thinking level (off/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh) |
| `/verbose on\|off` | Toggle verbose output |
| `/usage off\|tokens\|full` | Per-response usage footer |
| `/tts on\|off` | Control text-to-speech |
| `/skill <name>` | Run a skill by name |
| `/whoami` | Show your sender ID |
| `/help` | Show available commands |

Groups: configure `channels.telegram.groups` for allowlisting, mention gating, and activation modes.

Docs: [Telegram](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/channels/telegram) · [Groups](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/concepts/groups)

---

## Security Defaults

Crocbot connects to real messaging surfaces — treat inbound DMs as **untrusted input**.

- **DM pairing** (`dmPolicy="pairing"`) — unknown senders must pair before the bot responds
- **Exec allowlisting** — shell commands are gated by an allowlist
- **SSRF protection** — private IP/hostname blocking on all outbound fetches
- **Sandbox mode** — run non-main sessions (groups) in per-session Docker sandboxes
- **`crocbot doctor`** — audit tool that surfaces risky or misconfigured policies

Details: [Security](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/gateway/security) · [Sandboxing](https://aiwithapex.mintlify.app/install/docker)

---

## Agent Workspace & Skills

- **Workspace root:** `~/croc` (configurable via `agents.defaults.workspace`)
- **Prompt files:** `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`
- **Skills:** `~/croc/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- **31 bundled skills** including weather, GitHub, Spotify, Notion, Trello, Obsidian, PDF generation, image generation, transcription, browser automation, and more

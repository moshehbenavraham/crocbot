# TOOLS.md - User Tool Notes (editable)

This file is for *your* notes about external tools and conventions.
It does not define which tools exist; crocbot provides built-in tools internally.

## Examples

### ssh
- Known hosts and aliases, preferred ports.

Add whatever else you want the assistant to know about your local toolchain.

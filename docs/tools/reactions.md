# Reaction tooling

Shared reaction semantics across channels:

- `emoji` is required when adding a reaction.
- `emoji=""` removes the bot's reaction(s) when supported.
- `remove: true` removes the specified emoji when supported (requires `emoji`).

Channel notes:

- **Telegram**: empty `emoji` removes the bot's reactions; `remove: true` also removes reactions but still requires a non-empty `emoji` for tool validation.
